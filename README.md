# http-image-server

## Design Notes

* Zero dep
* will need to store thumbnails (files preferred over a cache blob)
* cwd
* recursive
* list of file from stdin (which introduces discontinuities, needing clever indenting)

## My attempts

## Other projects
* https://github.com/nikhilweee/shis - very good. Only downside is having to click to go into subdirs, and pagination (both of which are necessary for good performance)
